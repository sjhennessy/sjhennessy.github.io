Belly Button Biodiversity Project:
The dataset has been organized for ease of use. Each volunteer has an ID number and the user can select any of the ID numbers in the dropdown feature and obtain demographic information, the top 10 bacterial species in the volunteer's belly button, frequency of belly button washing, and a bubble chart showing all bacteria cultures associated with the ID number. The dataset will allow the Improbable Beef Company to identify the volunteers that have the desired bacteria needed to manufacture synthetic beef.
